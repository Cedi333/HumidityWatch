# HumidityWatch:
 An Application where it is possible to check the Humdity levels in your city and easily see whether it is
 a good time to cross-ventilate your living space to prevent mold and to create a nice living space.

The goal of the Application is to get push notifications on ones phone whenever it is a good time to open the window and let fresh air in, 
saving unnecessary calculation time. Through this app it is possible to save money by only ventilating at distinct times, avoid cold and humid 
outside air.
